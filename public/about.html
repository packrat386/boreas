    <h1>About Boreas</h1>
    <p>Boreas is a simple weather forecast front-end, powered by the NOAA National Weather Service. It uses data from the US Census Bureau to translate an address into a longitude and latitude, and then pulls a forecast for that location. Because it relies on US government datasets, it only works in the US.</p>
    <h2>How to use Boreas</h2>
    <p>To use Boreas go to the <a href="/forecast">Forecast</a> page and input your address (or a nearby address) and click "Submit" to see the current forecast. Boreas displays a 7 day forecast with each day broken into day and night sections (14 sections total). You can click on a section to see the hourly forecast for that particular section.</p>
    <p>Once you have submitted an address it will be added as a parameter to the URL, so you can bookmark that URL to return to later and save yourself having to input your address again</p>
    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    <p>Boreas is implemented as a Ruby on Rails application. You can check it out on <a href="https://github.com/packrat386/boreas">GitHub</a>. It is MIT licensed, and you are welcome to run your instance if you like.</p>
